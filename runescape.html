		<h2>What is OSRS?</h2>
			<p>OSRS is a medieval MMORPG built around resource gathering and skill progression.<br>
			Players progress 23 different skills in order to improve their gear, earn money, kill stronger
			monsters, and complete quests. </p>
		<h2>This is my character.</h2>

		<p>Lately I have been mostly playing the ironman and Leagues gamemodes of the game. In
		   ironman mode, players are not allowed<br> to trade with other players and thus must get
		   all of their materials on their own. The Leagues gamemode is similar to ironman<br> mode 
		   but provides a number of modifiers to the game to make things faster and more interesting.</p>
		<p>I especially enjoy OSRS because has a great sense of progression as well as the fact that I
		   am usually able to do other things while<br> I play it, like watch lectures, do homework, or 
		   watch movies. Admittedly, due to being inside a lot due to quarantine, it has become
		   one of my biggest hobbies!</p>
