		<h1>Vampire Weekend</h1>
			<p>This is a page about my favorite band, Vampire Weekend. Vampire Weekend is an indie rock
			   band based out of New York City led by frontman and lead singer Ezra Koenig. The band is
			   noted for their unique "Baroque pop" style. Baroque pop combines modern rock 
			   with elements of classical music, such as the use of violins and harpsichords. This,
			   along with their unique lyrical style, makes for an excellent listening experience that
			   I have not been able to find from any other artist.</p>

		<p>My favorite Vampire Weekend album is the album shown above, <i>Contra</i>, released in January 2010.
		   The album is significantly more experimental than their previous work, the self-titled album
		   <i>Vampire Weekend</i>, and explores a much wider array of musical genres. This project was
		   significantly more ambitious than their first, and I believe it to be a much more complete and
		   enjoyable musical experience. If I could recommend any songs off of this album to a new listener,
		   I would encourage them to check out "Diplomat's Son," "Taxi Cab," and "White Sky."</p>
