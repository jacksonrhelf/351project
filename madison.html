		<h1>Madison, WI</h1>
		<p>This page is about the town that I currently live in, Madison, WI. Madison is located in the 
		   south central region of Wisconsin and is the state's<br> second largest city after Milwaukee.
		   Madison is often noted for its natural beauty due to its location in the middle of a number
		   of scenic lakes,<br> namely Mendota and Monona. It is also famous for the university that I
		   attend, the University of Wisconsin-Madison. UW-Madison is often recognized<br> as one of the
		   top universities in the country. All of this combines to make Madison a great place to live.</p>

		<p>Madison is unique in that it has the makings of both a big and small town. The downtown
		   area is always active and busy, but taking<br> just a two mile walk in any direction
		   will lead you into quaint and quiet neighborhoods. There is always something to do in
		   Madison, from<br> enjoying a pitcher at the Memorial Union Terrace to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfUbtH7zz1g">
		   jumping around</a> at a Badger football game. If you have never visited the city, it is 
		   absolutely worth taking a drive to spend a day in Madison!</p>
